  <h3>About the website</h3>
  <p>
    This purpose of this website is to familiarize younger people with a specific type of engineering, Mechanical Engineering.
     We provide an informational overview about this specific type of engineering like important people and fun facts.
      In addition, we provide a fun activity that gives an insight of the kind of work mechanical engineers do.
    The activity is made up of 2 different forms.</p>
    <p>The first form collects the temperatures of the components that the
     user chooses along with their name and number of tries and sends it to MySQL database using php. The temperatures are 
     calculated using JavaScript and alerts are sent out to notify the user of their progress on command. The user only gets
      5 tries to determine a configuration that doesn’t overheat the circuit board. On the fifth try their results are sent 
      to the database unless they can do it earlier.</p>
      <p>
    The second form collects the locations of the components and determines whether they are the right distance so that.
     The user only gets one try to configure these components and a Boolean result is send to the database, either pass or fail. However, the second form does not create new rows in the database. Their score is added to the data in the previous form using the update functionality. Finally, there is a view all results option where the user can view everyone’s scores in a table and in that display [age the user can manage the data by deleting rows of their choice.
